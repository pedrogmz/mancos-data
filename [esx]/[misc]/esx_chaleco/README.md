# X-Vest
The ultimate vest script for fivem

 # Overview
This script provides three types of armour Light, Medium, Heavy,
each has their own configurable value of armour and time it takes to put on. Each time you take an armour out a cooldown takes effect and you will have to wait till it is over to use another armour.

For light armour you can take it our anywhere but it only gives 25 %. For medium and heavy you have to take it out from a car and it takes much longer to put on. Medium gives you 50% and heavy gives you 75%.

When you have the armour in your hand you can do 4 things. 

*You can hit **E** to use the armour.*

*You can hit **G** to give the armour to the closest person to you.*

*You can drop the armour on the ground by hitting 7, when on the ground if near it you can use it or give it to someone* 

*You can hit **H** to cancel the event and delete the armour*

When giving armour you the cooldown only affects the person that takes the armour out of the car. In addition, the script will identify you as had given the armour and with this, you can have different times to put the vest on. When you have the vest in your hands you have 2 mins ( can be changed ) to do something with the vest or it will delete its self ( in order to reduce server lag ).

Also, you can do /removevest to take the vest off and give it to someone else or delete it. When taking it off the vest bases itself on how much value it has. So if you had a heavy vest but it was shot and the value is now 60 then the vest will classify as a medium vest.

# Use

# Notes
To use this script to its best you should have [Mythic Progress Bar](https://forum.fivem.net/t/dev-resource-mythic-progress-bar/527607) and [Mythic Notifications](https://forum.fivem.net/t/dev-resource-mythic-notifications/587071)
the parts that need this are commented out but can easily be replaced with other progress bar and notification scripts.
