# esx_minebitcoins

esx_minebitcoins is a pretty simple script I just wrote, first plan was to keep it private, but I wanted to give the community something.
This script allows players to mine bitcoins and sell them, with a lot of customizability in ```config.lua```.

I kindly ask you to report any bug/suggestion down below.
