Star✩Screamers Garage 1.1 YMAP

"In need for a small/medium sized garage/workshop for your game? Here's one located right in the classy and sassy neighbourhood of Vespucci Canals. Just under the wind of the local delicacy provider, Burger Shot, you can tinker with your rides until your heart, or customer is content. And who cares about the customer! You know you make quality builds, the people know it, so if the customer doesn't like it, they know where they can shove it!"

Initially created for personal use for comic bacground use, publishing screenshots immediately sparked a public interest. Fixing simple issues and polishing up the interior eventually took the better of a few weeks. Next to some successful beta testing in a FiveM server, it's confirmed that it works for FiveM as well! A big thanks to the friendly Ydrop team for this! (https://www.gta5-mods.com/users/Ydrop)

This garage will be used in my personal comic series 'Star✩Screamers', an adult comic based in an alternative GTA verse. Check it out on Pixiv if you feel like it! https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/77834870 (first page)

Installation instructions for FiveM:

Ydrop team has kindly provied the map structure for FiveM servers. Simply open the .rar and drop the contents within in your game file structure. Then add the line "add starscreamers_garage1.1" to your config.cgf and it should work.

NOTE:

Due to the nature of YMAP, entities and object spawns can't be negated and cars will more than often spawn inside the living quarters. Recommended is to remove them with ObjectSpooner with the Menyoo trainer, or any other trainer that allows this. Please beware of this phenomenon.
